# Toontown Rewritten different legs classification
## Description
Used supervised classification algorithms to try to predict whether members of dataset would have different coloured legs. Data collected by hand in January and February 2022; cleaned and visualized using Python (pandas, matplotlib, Seaborn), machine learning work carried out with scikit.learn
## Repository contents
The repository for this project contains my project writeup and two .csv files containing the training and testing datasets
## Status
Project completed. Future TTR machine learning work is envisioned, ideally with a focus on contexts exhibiting more systematicity where conclusive results are more likely to be achievable
