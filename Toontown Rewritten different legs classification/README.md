# Toontown Rewritten different legs classification
## Description
I utilized various supervised classification algorithms to try to predict whether members of the dataset had legs which were a different colour than the rest of their body. Data was collected in January and February 2022, cleaned and visualized using Python (pandas, matplotlib, Seaborn), and machine learning work was performed with scikit.learn and k-modes.
## Repository contents
The repository for this project contains a written research report and two .csv files containing the training and testing datasets. The report was originally published in March 2022 and some minor revisions were made in November 2023. 
## Status
Project completed. Future TTR machine learning work is envisioned, ideally with a focus on contexts exhibiting more systematicity where conclusive results are more likely to be achievable.
