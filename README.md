## Toontown Rewritten different legs classification
Carried out between January and March 2022, this project attempted to predict whether or not Toons in the MMORPG Toontown Rewritten had legs which are a different colour than their body using supervised classification algorithms, namely logistic regression, random forest classifiers, and support vector machines. Data was collected by hand and analysis was carried out in Python using k-modes and scikit-learn. The folder contains a writeup of the project and my training and testing datasets
