## Toontown Rewritten different legs classification
Carried out between January and March 2022, this project attempted to predict whether or not Toons in the MMORPG Toontown Rewritten had legs which are a different colour than their body using supervised classification algorithms, namely logistic regression, random forest classifiers, and support vector machines. Data was collected by hand and analysis was carried out in Python using k-modes and scikit-learn. The folder contains a writeup of the project and my training and testing datasets. I applied minor revisions to my research paper in November 2023. 

## Dota hero clustering with k-means
Carried out in March 2022 and revised slightly in November 2023, this project applied k-means clustering, an unsupervised learning algorithm, to a dataset consisting of various base attributes of heroes from the game Dota 2. Each hero is a member of one of three categories, and the goal of the project was to group the members of the dataset into three clusters based on attribute values and subsequently evaluate how closely the cluster assignments corresponded to actual category membership. High accuracy was achieved; final cluster assignments corresponded very closely to true categories. The folder consists of all code implemented to carry out the task as well as the dataset, which can also be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prokid1911/dota-2-all-hero-data-727d
